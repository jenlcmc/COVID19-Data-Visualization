# Description

This respitory contain a Jupyter notbook that will showcase COVID-19 cases in United States or State depend on user choice. 

The respitory conatin data set from the respitory made by [NYTIMES](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)

It will also does data visualization for death cases & total cases depend on user choice 

In addition, the data visualization will display positive & death cases for 3 states
    - Nevada
    - New York 
    - California

The data will be update each time the user run the Jupyter notebook and it updated through the data set provided from the NYTIMES respitory.

Currently, the respitory only allow you to see how it work, no interaction yet unless you download it and run locally

But in the future, I will use Google Collab so that user can interact without download it to local machine
